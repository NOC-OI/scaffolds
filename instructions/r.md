To follow along with the R lesson, we will be using RStudio Cloud. Please 
follow these instructions carefully.

1. Click on the link given to you by your instructor; this will open a login
   prompt. You should log in using one of the three provided methods (Google,
   GitHub, or create a username and password).

   > Note: if the service gives you an error message that says “You do not have
   > access”, reenter the URL to try again (do not try to refresh).
2. Once you log in, you will see a temporary project screen. 
   Click on the "Save a permanent copy" button in the top right to save it to
   your account.

3. At this point, you will be in their own private copy of the project. Any
   changes you make will be saved. When you close their session, you can
   restore it by visiting <https://rstudio.cloud> (not the link your
   instructor gave you) and clicking on the project on your homepage

### Please note

 - The lesson will instruct you to use nano. RStudio Cloud does not have nano
   installed, so you will need to use RStudio's text editor under
   <kbd>File > New > Text Document</kbd>
 - Copy and paste keyboard shortcuts do not work, you must use the mouse.
