To follow along with the lesson, we will be using [My
Binder](https://mybinder.org) to host an online version of OpenRefine. Please
follow these instructions carefully.


1. Open this link in a new window/tab: <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/betatim/openrefineder/master?urlpath=%2Fopenrefine>
2. This will take anywhere from 30 seconds to 10 minutes to load, so be patient
   ![open refine loading](img/openrefine-start.png)
3. Once it loads, you will see a window that matches an OpenRefine session.
   Please ignore the yellow warning bar at the top saying there is a new
   version of OpenRefine.

You can use files from your computer just like the installed version of OpenRefine. 


### Please note

 - My Binder FAQ: <https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html>
 - Everything in the binder session is temporary
 - You will need to keep the URL your instructor gave you handy. 10 minutes of
   inactivity will result in the session being shut down with all progress lost. 
 - [Everything done in the the Binder session is potentially visible to the world](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#can-i-push-data-from-my-binder-session-back-to-my-repository)

The only known issue is that it is not currently possible to upload previous
OpenRefine projects.
