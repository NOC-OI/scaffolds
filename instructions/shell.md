To follow along with the lesson, we will be using [My
Binder](https://mybinder.org), please follow these instructions carefully.



1. Open the link in the browser and wait for it to fully load
   ![Binder loading screen](img/binder-start.png) (This can take anywhere from
   **30 seconds to 10 minutes to load**)
   > Note: if any error occurs, reload the page to try again.
2. Double click on the data/ directory and click on the "New" button in the top
   right to select a new Terminal window.

Data in the Binder session is not persistant, you will need to download all new
scripts and data and re-upload them before and after breaks. 

For the next session, if you are using the same materials, then you should
upload your notebook (which is a three step process of pressing "Upload",
choosing the file, and then pressing "Upload" for that file) ![Two step process

 - You will need to keep the URL your instructor gave you handy. 10 minutes of
   inactivity will result in the session being shut down with all data lost.
