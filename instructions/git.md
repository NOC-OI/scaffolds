To follow along with the Git lesson, we will be using RStudio Cloud. Please 
follow these instructions carefully.

1. Navigate your browser to <https://rstudio.cloud> and login/sign up as needed

### Please note

 - The lesson will instruct you to use nano. RStudio Cloud does not have nano
   installed, so you will need to use RStudio's text editor under
   <kbd>File > New > Text Document</kbd>
 - Copy and paste keyboard shortcuts do not work, you must use the mouse.
